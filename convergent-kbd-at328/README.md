Board: Atmega328 on a breadboard

Makefile notes:
   Makefile is highly customized to my home setup.
   You'll need to update it for your paths.

   "make help"  -- shows the help
   "make show_boards" -- shows the boards
   "make" -- makes everything
   "make ispload" -- burns using the usbasp
   "make set_fuses" -- burns the fuses

   My arduino directory has "atmega328 on a breadboard" manually copied into the tree.
